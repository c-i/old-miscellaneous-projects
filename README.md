A couple of small personal projects I worked on in 2020-2021.

1. (2020) Using Poisson distributions to predict the outcomes of Premier League football matches.  Probably incorrectly implemented, but was my first exposure to loading/dumping data from/to CSV files and creating a CLI tool in Python.  My first "real" program in Python.

2. (2020-2021) A triangular arbitrage program to detect arbitrage opportunities and execute trades on a given exchange.  Uses CCXT to retrieve exchange data and execute trades.  Missing a number of files, one being the script that executes trades.  A couple being scripts made to retrieve, format, and dump data regarding valid arbitrage triangles.  One such script was custom made for an exchange that was not supported by CCXT.
